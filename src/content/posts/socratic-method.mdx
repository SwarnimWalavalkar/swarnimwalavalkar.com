To put it into action, follow this general structure:

1. Start with open-ended questions.
2. Propose ideas based on these questions.
3. Probe these ideas with progressive questioning.
4. Repeat 2/3 until the best ideas are developed.

Here's a process of how you might apply Socratic Questioning:

- Start asking questions: What's the problem you are trying to solve? We often
  waste time and energy trying to solve the "wrong" problem. Identify the
  “right” problem before you try to solve it.

- Propose your current thinking on the problem: What is your hypothesis? What
  are the origins of that thinking?

- Open the floor for targeted questioning: Why do you think this? Is the
  thinking too vague? What is it based upon?

- Challenge the assumptions underlying the original thinking: Why do you believe
  this to be true? How do you know it’s true? How would you know if you were
  wrong? Identify the source of beliefs on a problem. Be ruthless in evaluating
  their integrity and validity.

- Evaluate the evidence used to support the thinking: What concrete evidence do
  I have? How credible is it? What “hidden evidence” may exist?

- Understand the consequences of being wrong: Can an error be quickly fixed? How
  costly is this mistake? Always understand the stakes.

- Evaluate potential alternatives: What alternative beliefs or viewpoints might
  exist? Why might they be superior? Why do others believe them to be true? What
  do they know that I don’t? Evaluate them on their merits and ask these same
  fundamental questions about them.

- After zooming in, zoom out: What was my original thinking? Was it correct? If
  not, where did I err? What conclusions can I draw from the process about
  systemic errors in my thinking?
