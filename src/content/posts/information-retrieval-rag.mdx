The following are notes from some of my learnings studying and building
retrieval systems for RAG applications.

## Full-Text Search vs Vector Search

Vector search excels at capturing semantic similarity, making it great for
understanding the general meaning and context of queries. However, it has
limitations, particularly when dealing with specific keyword-based queries or
named entities.

For instance, when users search for names acronyms, or IDs (e.g.,
`claude-3.5-sonnet`).

This is where a hybrid approach shines;

You can create a more robust and accurate retrieval system by combining:

- Traditional full-text search for precise keyword matching
- Vector search for semantic understanding
- Metadata filtering to scope the search space

---

## Hybrid Search

The decision to use hybrid search depends on your use case; For technical
documentation where users need to find specific API endpoints or error codes,
keyword search excels at exact matches.

For a research paper database where users explore related concepts and
methodologies, semantic search might better capture topical relevance.

For a knowledge base where users might search for specific terms but also need
contextually related information, a hybrid approach combines precise matching
with semantic understanding.

### Combining Search Techniques

One straightforward approach to implementing hybrid search is to combine
traditional keyword matching with semantic search through score fusion.

In this method, we first run both searches in parallel: a keyword search for
exact matches and a vector search for semantic similarity. Each returns a scored
list of results. These scores are then normalized and combined using a weighted
sum:

```
final_score = α * keyword_score + (1 - α) * semantic_score
```

Where `α` is a tunable parameter which prioritizes certain documents based on
factors like their relevance to the search query, their ranking in the
individual lists, or other criteria.

The result is a final list that integrates the strengths of both keyword and
semantic search methods.

### Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

Another common approach to combine results is Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). RRF
assigns higher weights to items that appear near the top of multiple result
lists.

For each document d, the RRF score is calculated as:

```
RRF(d) = Σ(r ∈ R) 1 / (k + r(d))
```

Where:

- `d` is a document
- `R` is the set of rankers (retrievers)
- `k` is a smoothing constant that prevents disproportionate influence of
  top-ranked items _(typically 60)_
- `r(d)` is the rank of document `d` in ranker `r`

For example, if a document ranks 3rd in keyword search and 9th in semantic
search with _`k=60`_:

```
RRF = 1/(60 + 3) + 1/(60 + 9) = 0.0317
```

Documents appearing in only one list get zero contribution from the other list.
The final results are sorted by descending RRF score.

This method effectively balances results that perform well across multiple
search strategies while dampening the impact of outlier rankings.

Reference implementation in JavaScript:

```js
function reciprocalRankFusion(results, options = {}) {
  const {
    k = 60,
    maxResults = 10,
    scoreThreshold = 0,
    includeScores = true,
  } = options;

  const rrfScores = new Map();
  const docDetails = new Map();

  // Process each result list
  results.forEach((resultList, retrieverId) => {
    resultList.forEach((doc, rank) => {
      const rrf = 1 / (k + (rank + 1));
      const currentScore = rrfScores.get(doc.id) || 0;
      rrfScores.set(doc.id, currentScore + rrf);

      // Store document details from first occurrence
      if (!docDetails.has(doc.id)) {
        docDetails.set(doc.id, {
          ...doc,
          ranks: new Map(),
        });
      }

      // Track rank in each retriever
      docDetails.get(doc.id).ranks.set(retrieverId, rank + 1);
    });
  });

  // Build final results
  const fusedResults = Array.from(rrfScores.entries())
    .filter(([_, score]) => score >= scoreThreshold)
    .map(([id, score]) => ({
      ...docDetails.get(id),
      ...(includeScores && { rrf_score: score }),
      ranks: Object.fromEntries(docDetails.get(id).ranks),
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.rrf_score - a.rrf_score)
    .slice(0, maxResults);

  return fusedResults;
}

// Example usage with options
const results = reciprocalRankFusion([keywordResults, semanticResults], {
  k: 60,
  maxResults: 5,
  scoreThreshold: 0.01,
  includeScores: true,
});
```

## Query Reformulation

Raw user queries often lack context or contain ambiguous references. Rather than
taking these queries at face value, query reformulation acts as a preprocessing
step that transforms them into more complete, self-contained expressions.

The goal is to add implicit context that users typically omit, resolve ambiguous
references, and expand queries with relevant terms.

For instance, a query like _"How did we do this quarter?"_ might be reformulated
to _"What is the revenue for Q1 2025?"_ - adding both the specific metric
(`revenue`) and temporal context (`Q1 2025`) that was implicit in the original
query.

One way to implement this is to maintain a context window containing recent
conversation history, currently visible information, and relevant system state.

An LLM can then be used to reformulate queries by identifying contextual
references, resolving pronouns, and expanding abbreviated expressions. For
example, _"Find similar docs"_ might become _"Find documentation similar to the
current deployment guide"_ when reformulated with appropriate context.

The key is ensuring that reformulated queries are self-contained while
preserving the original intent. This makes them more effective for downstream
search operations, whether using keyword, semantic, or hybrid approaches.

## Feature and Entity Extraction

Many search queries contain specific attributes that are better handled through
structured queries. By extracting these features first, we can leverage
traditional search infrastructure more effectively.

We can use LLMs to extract various features from the reformulated query. Each
feature extractor can run in parallel and should focus on specific attributes:

- Temporal expressions ("last week", "Q1", "2024")
- Named entities (people, organizations, products)
- Numerical ranges ("over 500", "between 10-20")
- Status indicators ("completed", "pending", "failed")
- Technical identifiers (API endpoints, error codes)

For example, given the query _"Show me failed deployments from last week in the
auth service"_, feature extraction might yield:

```json
{
  "deployed_at": {
    "range": "2024-12-28/2025-01-03",
    "confidence": 0.95
  },
  "status": {
    "value": "failed",
    "confidence": 0.98
  },
  "service": {
    "value": "auth",
    "confidence": 0.99
  }
}
```

## Closing Thoughts

The most robust retrieval solutions often combine multiple approaches. The goal
is to build systems that leverage both the semantic understanding of embeddings
and the precision of traditional search methods.

The key is choosing the right combination of techniques based on your specific
use case, and gradually add complexity only where it demonstrably improves
results.
