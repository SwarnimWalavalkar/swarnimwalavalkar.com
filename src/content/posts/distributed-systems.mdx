A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements that
appears to its users as a single coherent system.

## Features of distributed systems:

- A collection of computing elements (nodes) each able to behave differently
- Clients believe they're dealing with a single system. The Independent nodes
  have to collaborate

### Autonomous Compute Units

- Fundamentally, nodes act Independently from each other
- Nodes communicate by exchanging messages (cf. event driven systems)
- Nodes have their own notion of time, ie. No global clock
- Relationship between nodes in a collection need to be managed (register which
  nodes do or do not belong in the system)
  - **open group:** any node can join the system, it can communicate with any
    other node
  - **closed group:** only members of a group can communicate with each other,
    separate mechanism is needed for a node to leave or join a group

Distributed systems are often organized as an _overlay network_, where a node is
a process with a list of other nodes it can directly send messages to. There are
roughly two typed of overlay networks

**Structured Overlay:** Each node has a well-defined set of neighbors with whom
it can communicate. The nodes are organized in a tree or logical ring.

**Unstructured Overlay:** Each node has a number of references to randomly
selected other nodes.

An overlay network should, in principle, always be connected, meaning that
between any two nodes there is always a communication path allowing those nodes
to route messages from one to the other.

cf: Peer-To-Peer (P2P) networks.

### Single Coherent System

- A distributed system should appear as a single coherent system.
- A distributed system is coherent if it behaves according to the expectations
  of its users.
- In a single coherent system the collection of nodes as a whole operates the
  same, no matter where, when, and how interaction between a user and the system
  takes place.

## Design Goals

### Performance

- Distributing computation
  - Cons: network and latency bottlenecks - Tricks that help: caching, async
    programming
  - Pros: parallelism, client can pick geographically proximate server
    - Scalability:
      - ideally, performance would linearly increase with the addition of new
        nodes `N x nodes -> N x throughput`
  - Need to balance based on some factor N
    - divide the state by N (In the example of a file system)
      - split by user
      - split by file name
      - Sharding or Partitioning
    - Wont always work -> can only scale so far (potential drawbacks)
      - Global operations, eg search
      - Load Imbalance
        - One very active user
        - One very popular file
          - -> one particular server takes all the load, other remain idle
          - = `N x nodes -> 1 x throughput`

### Fault Tolerance

- Availability The system keeps on serving as it normally would under certain
  kinds of failures
  - fail-over
    - active-passive
      - heartbeats are sent between 2 servers (active and passive)
      - If the heartbeat is interrupted, passive server takes over the active
        one
      - downtime length can vary depending of whether the passive service was in
        "hot" standby or has to do a "cold" startup
      - Only the active server ever handles traffic
      - Also refereed to as master-slave failover.
  - replication
    - Master-Slave Replication
      - The master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more
        slaves, which serve only reads.
      - Slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion.
      - If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in
        read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is
        provisioned.
    - Master-Master Replication
      - Both masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on
        writes
      - If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both
        reads and writes
- Recoverability
  - The system gracefully recovers from failures and continues working correctly
    - store state on disk

### Consistency

- CAP Theorem
  - Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
  - Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it
    contains the most recent version of the information
  - Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary
    partitioning due to network failures

Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance. You'll
need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.

- **CP - consistency and partition tolerance** Waiting for a response from the
  partitioned node might result in a timeout error. CP is a good choice if your
  business needs require atomic reads and writes.

- **AP - availability and partition tolerance** Responses return the most
  readily available version of the data available on any node, which might not
  be the latest. Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is
  resolved.

AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when
the system needs to continue working despite external errors.
